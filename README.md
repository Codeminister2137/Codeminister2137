# Jakub Jaworski  
**Python Backend Engineer**

I’m a Python backend engineer focused on building **reliable, maintainable systems** and evolving them as requirements become clearer.

I enjoy turning ideas into working software, improving architecture over time, and choosing solutions that balance simplicity with real-world constraints.

---

## Technical focus

**Languages & frameworks**
- Python
- Django
- Flask
- FastAPI

**Backend & infrastructure**
- REST APIs
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Gunicorn
- NGINX

**Approach**
- Backend-first development
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Pragmatic architecture over premature optimization
- Iterative improvement based on real usage

---

## Selected projects

### Task Scheduler — Django (monolith)
A Docker-based Django application for scheduling tasks and reminders.

This project represents a complete, working backend system with:
- Django + PostgreSQL
- Redis
- NGINX reverse proxy
- Docker Compose–based local environment

Repository:  
https://github.com/Codeminister2137/Task-scheduler-django

---

### TSK — Task Scheduler (microservices)
A later iteration of the same domain, rebuilt using a **service-oriented approach**.

The system is split into dedicated services:
- authentication
- scheduling / calendar logic
- email notifications

Each service is implemented as a Django backend and composed together locally.

Main repository:  
https://github.com/Codeminister2137/tsk

Services:
- https://github.com/Codeminister2137/tsk-auth-service  
- https://github.com/Codeminister2137/tsk-calendar-service  
- https://github.com/Codeminister2137/tsk-email-service  

This project demonstrates architectural thinking, service boundaries, and infrastructure composition.

### Pin-voyage
A backend-driven map exploration project.

- Server-side map generation using Folium
- Users can create, share and rate interasting places and create trips that link them together
- No frontend framework — backend logic first

Repository:  
https://github.com/Codeminister2137/Pin-voyage

This project focuses on handling geospatial data and focuses on real user needs.

---

## How I work

- I value **code clarity and correctness**
- I prefer **simple solutions that are easy to reason about**
- I’m comfortable refactoring systems once requirements stabilize
- I focus on making software *work well* before making it fancy

---

## What I’m looking for

I’m looking for a **backend-focused role** where I can:
- work primarily with Python
- contribute to real systems in Django, Flask, or FastAPI
- grow through collaboration and code review
- take responsibility for backend features end-to-end
